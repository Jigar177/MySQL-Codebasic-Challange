# **Atliq Hardware : A financial and sales analysis**

#### Challenge
Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain

#### Domain
Consumer Goods | Function : Excecutive Management

## Problem statement

- Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware  producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
- However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make  quick and smart data-informed decisions.
- Hence, company decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help them to understand the data.

## Task :

1. Check [Jigar_Adhoc-Mysql_Project.pdf](Jigar_Adhoc-Mysql_Project.pdf) - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2. Need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
3. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence want to create a presentation to show the insights.

   
**Three things I learned from this challenge:**

I've used **MySQL** to query the data base. The database file is available in [Atliq_sql_challenge.sql](Atliq_sql_challenge.sql) file.

* Querying the database for business insights required the use of many important SQL concepts such as CTE, Multiple Joins, Subqueries, Window functions, and so on.

* I learned about fiscal years, gross sales, and converting years to fiscal years.

* Using Canva's various features to create effective presentation slides

**Tools used:**

* MYSQL Workbench: To query data from the database.

* Power BI Desktop: To visualize data.

* Canva: To create presentation slides.
